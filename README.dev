Have got as far as i could without Ryan, was asked to go do some work on Cur8r with mac (cur8r?? for 2019?)
Anyway..

Wierd issue with Pie, have reformatted the data correctly. Needs to be refactored back into the structure of the overall refactor, but for 
now it presents what should be the correct data format according to docs ( [{name:'slice',value:100},{name:'blah',value:200}] )
Ryan - I have a feeling you found the solution to a similar SVG issue yesterday .. maybe i'm missing something

Scatter is causing a wierd crash.
Counter has an error with Average of statements when returning null breaks 'toLocaleString'
Some kind of wierd component lifecyle issue causing rerendering at each stage of save.

Most of the work was on /Users/danstein/HT2LABS/learninglocker/ui/src/utils/visualisationResults/getFormattedResults.js
and
/Users/danstein/HT2LABS/learninglocker/ui/src/containers/Visualisations/Viewer/utils/getGroupedResults.js
have tried to work around the existing functions.

Lots left to do but be great if someone can look at pie and line issue? : )

bye.
